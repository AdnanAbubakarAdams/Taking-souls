// scope in Javascript refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of variables in javascript
// There are two types of scopes: Local scope and Global Scope

// Local variables are those declared inside of a block and are only accesible within that block
// Global variables are those declared outside of a block and are accesible throughout the file

// Var varibles automatically move to the global scope which can create unintended problems in your code

// Using Let and Const can be much more precise. this can be evidently sseen with functions
