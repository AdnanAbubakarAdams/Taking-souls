- Trapping Rain Water (Case Study)

1. Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the

width of each bar is 1,
compute how much water it is able to trap after raining. 
2. Use the following array as your functions input:
[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
3. Log and call the function which should successfully return the computation of how
much water this blueprint array is able to trap after raining
