// PRIMITIVE TYPES IN JAVASCRIPT
Number
String
Boolean
null
undefined

// R E P L => read  evaluate print loop

// NUMBERS
positive
negative
whole 
decimal

// P E M D A S => paranthesis exponents multiplication division addition substraction

NaN
// the intentional abscence of a number. or a numeric value that represents something that is...not a number

// VARIABLES => are like labels for values. we can store a value and give it a name so that we can:
// 1. refer back to it later  2. use that value to do stuff  3. or change it later on
example 
// using the LET keyword
let year = 1991;
// make me a variable called "year" and give it the value of 1991
let  numHens = 6;
let numRoosters = 2;
console.log(numHens + numRoosters)
let totalChicken = numHens + numRoosters;
console.log(totalChicken);

let myScore = 0;
myScore += 5;
console.log(myScore);

// using the CONST keyword
// const works just like let. except you  cannot change the value

String =>
// STRINGS => are just another primitive types in javaScript. they represt text and must be wrapped in quotes.
example 
let userName = "Adnan";
console.log(userName)
// strings are indexed, each character has a corresponding index (a positional number)
// eg: C H I C K E N
//     0 1 2 3 4 5 6
// String concatenation
let firstName = "Adnan";
let lastName = "Adams";
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;

// STRING METHODS => methods are built-in actions we can perform with individual strings
// they help us do things like ==> searching within a string, replacing part of a string, changing the casing of a string
